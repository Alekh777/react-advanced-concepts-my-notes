#### Key Concept from the Image
<p>
Reactâ€™s lifecycle is split into two phases:

1. Render Phase (top half in image):
    - Calls constructor and render for all components.
    - Pure functions only, no side effects.
    - Can be paused or restarted.

2. Commit Phase (bottom half in image):
    - React updates the DOM and refs.
    - Executes componentDidMount or componentDidUpdate.
    - Side effects are allowed here.
</p>

#### Example Component Hierarchy

```jsx
<Parent>
  <Child1 />
  <Child2 />
</Parent>
```

#### Lifecycle Execution Order (Mounting)
```txt
--- Render Phase (Top of the image) ---
Parent constructor
Parent render
Child1 constructor
Child1 render
Child2 constructor
Child2 render

--- Commit Phase (Bottom of the image) ---
Child1 componentDidMount
Child2 componentDidMount
Parent componentDidMount
```

<b>Note: All render() methods are called first for the entire tree (top to bottom), then React moves to the commit phase.</b>

<b>React batches the commit phase: it renders the full virtual DOM tree first, and then applies changes (DOM + componentDidMount) in one go to ensure consistency and avoid unnecessary DOM work.</b>
