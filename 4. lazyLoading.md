#### What is lazy loading/code splitting?
chunking, lazy loading, code splitting, dynamic bundling, on demand loading, dynamic import - all of these are same and called with different names.

Basically, hota kya hai ki, react ek hi bundle create karta hai javascript file ka, to agar hum network tab me jaakar dekhein to 1 hi JS file download hoti hai, jisme sab kuch rehta hai. Issi 1 JS file ko split kiya jaata hai into multiple files, so that the load is distributed and when those other files are required, they can be loaded on need basis, if we go on to that part of the page. This is what code splitting is. Aur hum uss part ko lazy load/code split karte hain jis page ki ek seperate responsibility hai. So suppose makemytrip has a flights section to book flights and a trains section to book train tickets. So these 2 can be seperate and code can be split for these 2.

We import the component to be lazy loaded using this:
`const MyLazyComponent = lazy(() => import('./MyLazyComponent'));` and then wrap the component while being called with `Suspense` component.

```jsx
import React, { lazy, Suspense } from 'react';

const MyLazyComponent = lazy(() => import('./MyLazyComponent'));

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
        <MyLazyComponent />
      </Suspense>
    </div>
  );
}

export default MyComponent;
```
